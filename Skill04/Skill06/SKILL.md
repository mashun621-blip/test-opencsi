# LLM Wiki

An autonomous, self-compounding knowledge base in an Obsidian vault. You ingest raw sources (articles, PDFs, code, docs), synthesize them into interlinked wiki pages with `[[wikilinks]]`, and periodic linting keeps everything consistent. Knowledge is pre-synthesized and cross-referenced — not re-queried from raw documents each time.

The human sources material and asks questions. You handle summarizing, cross-referencing, filing, and bookkeeping.

## Core Concepts

Three layers: Raw Sources (immutable inputs) → Wiki Pages (synthesized knowledge) → Index/Schema (coordination files).

Three operations: Ingest (source → pages), Query (search → answer), Lint (health checks).

---

## Setup

When the user asks to set up a new wiki:

1. **Ask language preference** — store in `.manifest.json` as `"language": "<code>"` (e.g. `"zh-CN"`, `"en"`). All wiki content uses this language; technical terms and proper nouns stay in their original language. Default to the user's current language if unspecified.

2. **Check dependencies** — verify required and optional packages:
   ```python
   python3 -c "import yaml; print('Python OK')"
   ```
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log('Node.js OK')"
   ```
   `pyyaml` and Node.js 18+ are required. `mineru` is optional (document extraction). Ask before installing into a venv:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv <vault-path>/.venv
   <vault-path>/.venv/bin/pip install pyyaml "mineru[all]"
   ```

3. **Create vault structure:**
   ```
   <vault-root>/
   ├── .obsidian/app.json       # Minimal Obsidian config
   ├── raw/                     # Immutable source documents
   │   └── .manifest.json       # Source tracking (hash, pages, language)
   ├── wiki/                    # Synthesized knowledge pages
   ├── index.md                 # Page catalog by category
   ├── log.md                   # Append-only operation history
   ├── schema.md                # Copy from references/schema.md
   └── .stats.json              # Page scoring counters
   ```

4. **Initialize files** — create `index.md`, `log.md`, `schema.md` (from `references/schema.md`), `.manifest.json`, `.stats.json` with their initial content (see Coordination Files section for schemas).

5. **Start PGlite sidecar** — required for search index and DatabaseBackend:
   ```bash
   node <skill-dir>/scripts/sidecar/server.js --data-dir <vault-path>/index
   ```
   This auto-initializes the schema on first run. Listens on port 5488 by default.

6. **Build the search index:**
   ```bash
   python <skill-dir>/scripts/index.py rebuild <vault-path>
   ```

7. **Register with Obsidian** (if installed): `open "obsidian://open?path=<vault-path>"`

8. **Gitignore** the vault directory if inside a tracked repo.

The subdirectories under both `raw/` and `wiki/` are **not prescribed** — they emerge from the content. The agent discovers files by scanning recursively. Common patterns include `concepts/`, `entities/`, `topics/`, `sources/`, `queries/` — but let the content dictate the taxonomy.

---

## Page Model

### Compiled Truth + Timeline

Every wiki page has two zones separated by `---`:

- **Above:** Compiled truth — current best understanding. Rewrite when new evidence changes the picture.
- **Below:** Timeline — append-only evidence trail (newest first). Never edit, only extend.

See `references/schema.md` for full templates and examples.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
aliases: []
tags: []
sources:
  - "[[raw/articles/source-name]]"
links:
  - {target: "page-slug", type: "references"}
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: active       # active | stub | needs-review | archived
weight: 0            # additive score boost (optional)
---
```

### Typed Links

Declare relationships in frontmatter `links:` — this is the authoritative edge set for graph queries. Wikilinks in prose are for readability.

Types: `references`, `contradicts`, `depends_on`, `supersedes`, `authored_by`, `works_at`, `mentions`. Extensible.

### Linking Rules

- Link target MUST be the exact filename without `.md`: `[[artificial-intelligence]]`
- Display text uses pipe syntax: `[[artificial-intelligence|AI]]`
- Never write bare `[[alias]]` — Obsidian does not resolve aliases in link targets
- See `references/obsidian.md` → "Wikilink Resolution Rules"

### Provenance Markers

- No marker = extracted from source
- `^[inferred]` = LLM-synthesized
- `^[ambiguous]` = sources disagree
- Frontmatter `status` is page-level; inline footnotes are claim-level. Both are complementary.

---

## Ingest

When the user provides source material (files, URLs, pasted text):

### Step 1: Accept and store the source

- **Local files**: Place anywhere inside `raw/` (flat or subdirectories)
- **URLs**: Fetch and save as `raw/<domain>-<slug>.md` with `source_url` in frontmatter
- **Pasted text**: Save to `raw/YYYY-MM-DD-<brief-slug>.md`
- **Binary files** (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, images, HTML): Extract first, then ingest the extracted markdown. Two approaches:

  **MineRU extraction** (recommended for complex documents):
  ```bash
  python <skill-dir>/scripts/extract.py <input-file>                    # auto-detect OCR need
  python <skill-dir>/scripts/extract.py --no-ocr <input-file>           # text-only, skip OCR (fastest)
  python <skill-dir>/scripts/extract.py --ocr <input-file>              # force OCR (scanned docs)
  python <skill-dir>/scripts/extract.py --fast <input-file>             # pipeline backend (CPU, faster)
  python <skill-dir>/scripts/extract.py --start 0 --end 10 <input-file> # page range only
  python <skill-dir>/scripts/extract.py <input-dir>                     # batch every file in dir (one mineru call)
  ```
  Record `extraction_method` in manifest: `mineru +ocr`, `mineru +txt`, `mineru`, or `fallback`.

  **Agent direct reading** (fallback):
  Read the file directly using your built-in file reading. Record `extraction_method: agent` in manifest (no `extracted` field). Works well for short, clean documents. Less reliable for scanned pages, complex tables, or large files.

- **Save a snapshot** for diff-based re-ingestion: `<source-path>.snapshot.md` (or `<extracted-path>.snapshot.md` for binaries)

### Step 2: Read and understand

- Read the source thoroughly
- Identify key concepts, entities, relationships, claims, open questions
- Check `index.md` for relevant existing pages

### Step 3: Compile into wiki pages

- **Existing page**: Update with new information. Merge, don't duplicate.
- **New topic**: Create using templates from `schema.md`
- Follow the page model (compiled truth + timeline, typed links, provenance markers)
- Every page gets a one-sentence summary lead

### Step 4: Cross-link and verify

- Use `[[wikilinks]]` for all references. Targets must be exact filenames.
- Scan existing pages for mentions of new concepts — add links there too
- Every page must be reachable from at least one other page
- For each unresolvable link target, create a stub:

```markdown
---
aliases: []
tags: [concept]
sources: []
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: stub
---
# Page Title
> [!todo] Stub
> Auto-created — expand when source material is available.
## Referenced from
- [[page-that-linked-here]]
```

Set the `tags` value to whichever type fits the context (`concept`, `entity`, `topic`, etc.).

### Step 5: Update coordination files

- **`index.md`**: Add/update entries for new/modified pages
- **`.manifest.json`**: Record source path, SHA-256, timestamp, pages created/updated
- **`log.md`**: Defer until after validation (Step 6)

### Step 6: Validate links

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/lint_links.py <vault-path> --files <pages...> --json
```

- **`alias_mismatches`**: Run again with `--fix` to rewrite `[[alias]]` → `[[filename|alias]]`
- **`missing`**: Create stubs (Step 4 template), re-run to confirm resolution
- Append to `log.md` only after validation passes (`clean: true` in JSON output)

Note: `--fix` with `--files` only repairs links in the specified files. For a complete vault-wide fix, run without `--files`.

### Step 7: Update page scores

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/score_pages.py <vault-path> --pages <pages...> --json
```

Also increment `access_count` in `.stats.json` for every existing page read during cross-linking in Steps 3–4. Use a single read-modify-write cycle to avoid partial updates.

### Batch ingestion

Process multiple sources in a single pass to maximize cross-referencing. Read all sources first, then compile pages that synthesize across them.

### Mass update safeguard

If an ingest would modify more than 10 existing pages, pause and list affected pages for user confirmation. Does not apply to creating new pages.

---

## Query

When the user asks a question about the wiki's knowledge:

### Step 1: Search (with optional expansion)

**If the index is available** (PGlite or Postgres running):

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/index.py query <vault-path> "query text" --json
python <skill-dir>/scripts/index.py query <vault-path> "query text" --expand --json
python <skill-dir>/scripts/index.py query <vault-path> "query text" --expand-thorough --json
```

This combines vector similarity + keyword search via reciprocal rank fusion (RRF). Results include chunk excerpts and scores. `--expand` generates paraphrases and averages their embeddings for a single fast search. `--expand-thorough` runs separate searches per paraphrase and fuses results (slower, better recall). Both require an expansion API (see Query Expansion in Supporting Tools).

**Narrow with attribute filters:**

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/query_filter.py <vault-path> --where "type=concept tag=strategy" --json
```

Filter syntax: `type=concept`, `tag=X`, `confidence>=0.7`, `updated_since=30d`, `has=field`, and comparison operators `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

**If no index is available:** Fall back to reading `index.md` and using grep/glob.

### Step 2: Rank and retrieve

Sort candidates by `computed_score` descending (from frontmatter). Read the highest-scored pages first.

### Step 3: Synthesize

Answer using the wiki's compiled knowledge. When multiple pages cover the same topic, weight higher-scored pages more. Cite sources with `[[wikilinks]]` — list higher-scored sources first.

### Step 4: Update counters

- Increment `access_count` in `.stats.json` for every page **read**
- Increment `query_count` in `.stats.json` for every page **cited in the answer**

### Step 5: File the answer (conditional)

Save as a page under `wiki/queries/` if the answer synthesizes across 3+ pages or reveals a non-obvious connection. Don't file simple lookups. Ask the user if borderline.

### Query output format

```markdown
## Answer
[Synthesized answer citing [[Wiki Page]] sources]

### Sources consulted
- [[wiki/concepts/concept-a]] — relevant because X
- [[wiki/entities/entity-b]] — mentioned Y
```

---

## Lint

Run periodically or when the user asks. Linting ensures wiki health.

### Automated checks

These are script-backed and produce structured output:

| Check | Command | Auto-fixable? |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Dead links** (alias mismatches + missing targets) | `lint_links.py <vault> --json` | Yes (`--fix` for aliases, stubs for missing) |
| **Stale pages** (timeline newer than compiled truth) | `lint_links.py <vault> --stale` | No — flag for rewrite |
| **Unbalanced pages** (5+ timeline entries since last rewrite) | `lint_links.py <vault> --unbalanced` | No — flag for review |
| **Orphaned pages** | `graph.py <vault> orphans` | No — add links or archive |
| **Score staleness** | `score_pages.py <vault> --json` | Yes — full recalc |

### Agent judgment checks

These require reading pages — no script automation:

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Missing cross-refs** | Pages that mention concepts without linking them |
| **Index drift** | Pages that exist but aren't in `index.md` |
| **Duplicate concepts** | Multiple pages covering the same topic |
| **Empty sections** | Placeholder sections never filled |
| **Frontmatter issues** | Missing required fields, outdated timestamps |
| **Schema drift** | Pages using outdated frontmatter (missing fields, deprecated tags) |

### Dead link resolution (two-phase)

**Phase 1 — Alias mismatches:** Run `lint_links.py <vault> --fix` to auto-rewrite `[[alias]]` → `[[filename|alias]]`.

**Phase 2 — Stub creation:** Create stub pages for remaining missing targets (use the stub template from Ingest Step 4).

Always run Phase 1 before Phase 2 — some "missing pages" are actually alias mismatches.

### Score recalculation

Run a full scoring recalc as part of every lint:

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/score_pages.py <vault-path> --json
```

Include in the lint report: top 10 pages by score, pages with zero activity.

### Lint report

Save to `wiki/lint-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Lint Report — YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
- X issues found, Y auto-fixed, Z need attention

## Auto-fixed
- Rewrote N alias mismatches
- Added stubs for M missing targets
- Recalculated all page scores

## Needs Attention
- [[concept-a]] stale — 3 new timeline entries since last rewrite
- [[entity-x]] orphaned — no incoming links
- [[concept-b]] and [[concept-c]] may be duplicates — consider merging
```

Append summary to `log.md`.

---

## Change Detection

### Auto-ingest (on conversation start)

When the wiki is in scope, scan for changes and ingest automatically:

1. **Scan:**
   ```bash
   python <skill-dir>/scripts/scan.py <vault-path> --json
   ```
   Detects: new files not in manifest, modified sources (hash mismatch), failed extractions (extracted file missing), low-quality extractions (<1% size ratio or <50 bytes).

2. **New files** → extract (if binary) and ingest via the full Ingest workflow
3. **Modified sources** → re-ingest using diff-based cascading update (below)
4. **Failed/low-quality extractions** → retry extraction

Report briefly: "Auto-ingested 2 new files, re-ingested 1 modified source. Created 5 pages, updated 2."

No user confirmation needed — **except** when the mass update safeguard applies (modifying >10 existing pages).

### Continuous monitoring (optional)

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/scan.py <vault-path> --watch 300               # scan every 5 min
python <skill-dir>/scripts/scan.py <vault-path> --watch 300 --auto-extract # scan + extract
```

Run in a terminal tab or cron job. Logs changes for the next conversation's auto-ingest.

### Cascading updates (diff-based re-ingestion)

When a source is modified:

**1. Diff the source:**
```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/diff_sources.py <source>.snapshot.md <new-source> --json
```
Produces added/removed/changed sections. If no snapshot exists, read the entire source.

**2. Scope the update:**
- Added sections → check if new pages needed
- Removed sections → check and remove obsolete claims
- Changed sections → update specific facts in affected pages
- Unchanged sections → skip entirely

**3. Update affected pages:**
- Check `.manifest.json` for which pages came from this source
- Modify only parts corresponding to changed sections — don't regenerate from scratch
- Follow the link graph: if changes affect linked pages (renamed concept, corrected fact), update those too

**4. Validate and finalize:**
- Validate links: `lint_links.py <vault-path> --files <modified-pages...> --fix`
- Save new snapshot (overwrite old)
- Update `.manifest.json` (new hash, timestamp, page lists)
- Update `index.md`, append to `log.md` (only after validation passes)

### Cascade depth

- **Factual correction**: Update page + pages citing the corrected fact
- **New information**: Update page + pages that benefit from new info
- **Structural change** (rename, merge): Follow all incoming links and update references

---

## Deleting and Archiving

### Removing a source

1. Delete the source file from `raw/` (or move to `_archive/`)
2. Remove its entry from `.manifest.json`
3. For pages solely derived from this source (no other sources in frontmatter): delete or set `status: archived`
4. For multi-source pages: remove references to the deleted source, keep the page
5. Run orphan check — fix dangling references from deleted/archived pages
6. Update `index.md`, append to `log.md`

### Archiving pages

Set `status: archived` in frontmatter rather than deleting. Preserves link history and allows recovery. Archived pages are excluded from query results by checking the status field.

### Page Scoring

Five indicators feed a composite `computed_score` written to each page's frontmatter:

| Indicator | Source | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Query frequency | `.stats.json` `query_count` | Pages cited in answers score higher |
| Access count | `.stats.json` `access_count` | Pages read more often score higher |
| Cross-ref density | Incoming `[[wikilinks]]` (scanned live) | Well-connected pages score higher |
| Manual weight | `weight` frontmatter field (default: 0) | User-set additive boost |
| Priority tags | `#pinned` +10, `#priority/high` +6, `medium` +3, `low` +1 | Fixed bonus |

Formula: `computed_score = (0.4 * norm(qf) + 0.3 * norm(ac) + 0.3 * norm(crd)) + weight + tag_bonus`

`norm()` scales 0–10 relative to max across all pages. Weights configurable in `.stats.json`.

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/score_pages.py <vault-path>                    # full recalc
python <skill-dir>/scripts/score_pages.py <vault-path> --pages <pages..>  # incremental
python <skill-dir>/scripts/score_pages.py <vault-path> --json             # structured output
```

### Search Index

Hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword) backed by PGlite (default) or native Postgres. PGlite is a required dependency — started during setup (step 5). The index is a **derived cache** — deleting it is always safe and it can be rebuilt.

**Database** (one of):
- **PGlite sidecar**: Requires Node.js 18+. Auto-initializes schema on first run. Listens on port 5488.
  ```bash
  node <skill-dir>/scripts/sidecar/server.js --data-dir <vault-path>/index
  ```
  Override URL: set `PGLITE_URL` env var.
- **Native Postgres**: Set `DATABASE_URL` env var. No Node.js needed.

**Embeddings** (one of):
- **Local**: `pip install sentence-transformers` — 384-dim, CPU, no API key
- **Remote** (any OpenAI-compatible API): Set `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` and optionally `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`
- **None**: Keyword-only search (no embedding dependency)

**Commands:**
```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/index.py rebuild <vault-path>              # full reindex
python <skill-dir>/scripts/index.py sync <vault-path>                 # incremental
python <skill-dir>/scripts/index.py query <vault-path> "text" --json  # hybrid search
python <skill-dir>/scripts/index.py verify <vault-path>               # health check
```

Run `sync` after every successful ingest and on conversation start. Run `verify` as part of lint.

**Embedding dimension changes:** `rebuild` auto-detects dimension mismatches and migrates the schema. `sync` warns and aborts if dimensions don't match — run `rebuild` to migrate.

### Graph Analysis

Analyze the wiki's link structure. Requires `pip install networkx` (degrades gracefully without it). Works from typed links in frontmatter (authoritative) with wikilinks in prose as fallback edges.

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/graph.py <vault-path> neighbors <slug> --depth 2
python <skill-dir>/scripts/graph.py <vault-path> path <from> <to>
python <skill-dir>/scripts/graph.py <vault-path> centrality --metric pagerank --limit 20
python <skill-dir>/scripts/graph.py <vault-path> communities
python <skill-dir>/scripts/graph.py <vault-path> orphans
python <skill-dir>/scripts/graph.py <vault-path> stats
```

All commands support `--format json` for structured output.

### Query Expansion

Generate query paraphrases for better search recall. Requires an LLM API.

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/expansion.py "search query"
```

Configure via env vars: `EXPANSION_PROVIDER` (`anthropic` or `openai`), `EXPANSION_API_KEY`, `EXPANSION_BASE_URL`, `EXPANSION_MODEL`. Falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` then `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Default models: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (Anthropic), `gpt-4o-mini` (OpenAI). Returns only the original query if no API is configured.

### Storage Backend

`scripts/storage.py` provides a `StorageBackend` protocol abstracting page CRUD, link management, and search.

**DatabaseBackend** (default): Database-first backend using PGlite or Postgres. DB is authoritative; markdown exported on demand. Supports full hybrid search (vector + keyword RRF), transactional batch operations, and all StorageBackend protocol methods. Shared SQL operations live in `scripts/db_ops.py`.

**FileVaultBackend** (offline fallback): Markdown files are authoritative. Keyword search only (no vector search). No database dependency. Use when PGlite/Postgres is unavailable.

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/storage.py <vault-path> list-pages
python <skill-dir>/scripts/storage.py <vault-path> get-page <slug>
python <skill-dir>/scripts/storage.py <vault-path> search "query"
```

### Document Extraction

See Ingest Step 1 for extraction commands. Additional scanning tool:

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/scan.py <vault-path> --json          # find work
python <skill-dir>/scripts/scan.py <vault-path> --auto-extract   # scan + extract
```

### Text Chunking

`scripts/chunking.py` splits pages into ~300-word chunks with 50-word overlap for embedding. Page-aware mode separates compiled truth from timeline. Used internally by `index.py` — agents rarely call this directly.

---

## Coordination Files

Reference schemas for files created during setup and maintained during operations.

### .manifest.json

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "sources": [],
  "version": 1
}
```

Populated entry:
```json
{
  "path": "raw/articles/microservices-design.pdf",
  "extracted": "raw/extracted/articles/microservices-design.pdf.md",
  "extraction_method": "mineru +ocr",
  "sha256": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "ingested_at": "2026-04-07T14:30:00Z",
  "size_bytes": 4523,
  "pages_created": ["wiki/concepts/microservices.md"],
  "pages_updated": ["wiki/entities/team-beta.md"]
}
```

Fields: `path` (relative to vault root), `extracted` (omit for text/markdown), `extraction_method` (`mineru +ocr`, `mineru +txt`, `mineru`, `fallback`, `agent`; omit for text/markdown), `sha256`, `ingested_at` (ISO), `size_bytes`, `pages_created`, `pages_updated`. Snapshots use deterministic naming (`<source-or-extracted-path>.snapshot.md`) and are not tracked in the manifest.

Compute SHA-256: `python3 -c "import hashlib,sys; print(hashlib.sha256(open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()).hexdigest())" <file>`

### .stats.json

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "weights": {
    "query_frequency": 0.4,
    "access_count": 0.3,
    "cross_ref_density": 0.3
  },
  "tag_bonuses": {
    "pinned": 10,
    "priority/high": 6,
    "priority/medium": 3,
    "priority/low": 1
  },
  "pages": {}
}
```

`weights` and `tag_bonuses` are user-tunable. See Page Scoring in Supporting Tools.

### .obsidian/app.json

```json
{
  "alwaysUpdateLinks": true,
  "newLinkFormat": "relative",
  "useMarkdownLinks": false,
  "strictLineBreaks": false,
  "showFrontmatter": false,
  "defaultViewMode": "preview",
  "livePreview": true
}
```

### index.md

```markdown
# Wiki Index

> Auto-maintained catalog of all wiki pages. Updated on every ingest.

## Concepts

## Entities

## Topics

## Sources

## Queries
```

Entries sorted by `computed_score` descending within each category: `- [[page-name]] (score: 9.2) — one-line summary`

### log.md

```markdown
# Operation Log

> Append-only record. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] action | subject`
> Actions: setup, ingest, re-ingest, query, lint, update

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] setup | Wiki initialized
- Vault created at `<path>`
```

Never deviate from this heading format — consistency enables grep-based parsing.

---

## Best Practices

### Session scoping
Each conversation should have a clear scope — don't re-process the entire wiki every time. Check `log.md` to understand what's been done, and focus on what's new or changed. This prevents infinite reprocessing loops. A comprehensive update is fine if the user asks — but don't initiate one unprompted.

### Concurrent access
This skill assumes single-writer access. If multiple agents or users edit simultaneously, `.manifest.json` and `index.md` can have write conflicts. Coordinate so only one session modifies the wiki at a time, or use git branching.

### Log rotation
When `log.md` exceeds ~100 entries, move older entries to `log-archive.md` and keep only the most recent 20.

### Scaling (100+ sources, 500+ pages)
- **Index**: When `index.md` exceeds ~200 entries, split into `index-concepts.md`, `index-entities.md`, etc., or switch to grep-based discovery
- **Cross-linking**: Use grep to search `wiki/` for concept names rather than reading every page. Target pages in related `index.md` categories first.
- **Lint**: Run targeted checks by default (affected pages only). Reserve full-vault lint for explicit user requests.

### Version control
Consider `git init` inside the vault for history and backup. The Obsidian Git plugin can automate commits.

### Obsidian integration
The wiki works as plain markdown with or without Obsidian. But Obsidian adds value through graph view, backlinks, and Dataview queries. See `references/obsidian.md` for the full reference (URI scheme, CLI, syntax, plugins).
